<h3>The best place to get mods for weapons and maps is 3dretreat. 
<br />
Go to rainbow six and then click rouge spear, in the next page click
<br />
downloads, there you should be able to get remade maps of originals. 
<br />
While you are there get the liquid and bsw mods, they with give a   
<br />
more stylish look to your game and collection. In liquid mods look   
<br />
for the swords and double golden dragons. I can't find this mod   
<br />
that is a space enviroment gameplay, it has lasers! have fun with that!
