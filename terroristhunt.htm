<p><br />
<h3>This Operation includes big teams in code name such as alpha, bravo, and charle.
<br />
This operation is necessary if there is a massive amount of damage and corruption with a 
<br />
commuity or sometimes a country, uselly there's a negitive plot formed by large armed forces
<br />
for large plantions. If such actions are taken, a terrorist hunt operation is made to eleminate 
<br />
a large amount of targets. In this option, you can call out teams in a group of four, each team has  
<br />
up to a maxinmum of four special force soldiers, the teams are color coded along with their group 
<br />
code name. In some missions, you will need a sniper to do his job while you send other individuals
<br />
to do their seperated plans, you can assign their plans. Weapons needed for this operation are uselly ones
<br />
that are loud and cause the most damage, for an all out weapon, the <em>SWAT</em> and the <em>COLT COMMANDO</em> are good 
<br />
choices. You will also be needing a side weapon such as a <em>heart beat sensor</em> or <em>jammer</em>(that works best).
