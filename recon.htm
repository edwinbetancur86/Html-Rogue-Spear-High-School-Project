<h3>This operation is for tactical intelligent stealth missions to 
<br />
mostly collect intelligence of terrorist activity within a premisses.
<br />
Since this is a lone wolf stealth operation, no combat is necessary,
<br />
you are not to be seen while carrying out your objectives. There is no
<br />
need of weapons, heart beat sensors or jammers are mostly used for   
<br />
operations like these. If there is any kind of fire or dection, the
<br />
mission is automatically aborted or failed. Operation difficultly
<br />
increases when there's big number of objectives,wide open spaces or terrorist.
