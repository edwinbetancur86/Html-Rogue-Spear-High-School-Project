<h3>This operation is for missions that need less work to complete objectives. 
<br />
This operation is also for avoiding the noise and room of teams to end the  
<br />
mission in a more non-stressful way. Since there is only one special force solider 
<br />
in this mission, the best form to be armed is the SWAT, COLT COMMANDO or STRUL AWG  
<br />
with a SILENTSER. Its highly recommened to use a heart beat sensor or jammer. The   
<br />
difficultly rises if: <u>there's more wide open spaces</u>, <u>a high number of targets</u>,  
<br />
or <u>stattered targets</u>.
